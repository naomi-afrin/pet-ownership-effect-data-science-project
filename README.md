# pet-ownership-effect-data-science-project
Analyzing the impact of pet ownership on stress relief, joy, and social well-being using data science and statistical testing.

This project investigates how owning pets influences stress relief, joy, social engagement, and overall well-being using statistical analysis and visual exploration.

## üìä Project Summary

We conducted a survey among university students to explore how pet ownership affects lifestyle and emotional well-being. The data was processed, cleaned, and analyzed using Python, with a focus on:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Hypothesis Testing
- Statistical Correlation
